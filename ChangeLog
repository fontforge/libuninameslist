    * Unicode 10.0_Beta (Nameslist.txt 10_Beta for review until Apr30).

- 2016-Jul-01
    * Version 1.0, Unicode 9.0, French version is 7.0(2014-06-22).
    * Corrected library to report correctly as next version up. This is
      probably a significant change, therefore bumped both libraries to
      start at 1.0 even though backwards compatibility remains the same,
      otherwise would have become version_0.6 (and French version_0.4).
    * Removed the excessively long package name, which you'll note as a
      so-bump change with Fedora and also Debian in naming this package.

- 2015-Jul-01

    * Cleaned up several warnings for program buildnameslist.

- 2013-May-01
    * Makefile.am problems in changing nameslist.h to uninameslist.h, and
      nameslist-fr.h to uninameslist-fr.h, therefore renamed those files.
    * Removed several files that can be built during autoreconf and automake
      steps to building a tar.gz package.
    * Added additional check for -enable-oldfrenchlib to "make distcheck"
    * This will be tagged as version 0.3
