      The French version was updated from version 10.0 to 13.0 shortly
      after Unicode's release - this is a big effort and congratulation
      to the French team! This version updates the main library to also

      need to use './configure --enable-frenchlib'
      This is the first step in adding other languages if anyone wants
      to add more languages.

      which is necessary for scripting, and/or file-sharing purposes.

      otherwise would have become version_0.6 (and French version_0.4).

      steps to building a tar.gz package.
